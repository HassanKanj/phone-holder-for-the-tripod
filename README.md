# Phone holder for the tripod (3D files)

Here’s a custom phone holder I designed that you can attach to your tripod.

This repo contains the design that I used but I have also included the design file (FreeCAD file) so you can modify the dimensions to suit your needs.

On a side note, I already have a FreeCAD course (in Arabic) on YouTube if you want to learn how to 3D design using the open source program FreeCAD, and here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH1UzPbO2F4&list=PL-pfG3NLl5jY2lb_iF0CPEH7DVZws4aDY

The 3D printed design can be be attached to the tripod using a 6mm nut (though it is not the perfect size, it didn't work on my first tripod, and it worked somehow on my second tripod, so I am planning to check other dimension(s) soon and will update the README accordingly) and you will also need a spring to attach the two 3D printed parts together.

## Notes

- I noticed that there are still some wobble after attaching the phone holder to the tripod, but it is still usable and good enough for my usage.

- You may need a vise to tightly fit the nut to the 3d printed part.
